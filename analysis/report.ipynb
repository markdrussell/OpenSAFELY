    "Autoimmune inflammatory arthritis (IA) encompasses an overlapping group of conditions that includes rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), and undifferentiated IA. Early diagnosis of IA and prompt treatment with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs; e.g. methotrexate) improves outcomes for patients and increases the likelihood of remission.\n",
    "\n",
    "In England and Wales, the quality of care for people with IA is benchmarked in the [National Early Inflammatory Arthritis Audit](https://www.rheumatology.org.uk/practice-quality/audits/neiaa) (NEIAA). Metrics benchmarked include the time from primary care referral to initial rheumatology assessment, and the time to initiation of a DMARD. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, mandatory data collection in NEIAA was paused, thereby preventing comparisons of care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this report is to use the OpenSAFELY platform to replicate key metrics from NEIAA, and assess the impact of COVID-19 on care for people with new diagnoses of IA in England. The results shown below are from a study population consisting of all patients aged 18 years or above who are registered with a general practice in England that uses TPP health software."
